A version of Geometry Dash built using the HaxeFlixel game engine for the purpose of modding.

This was made for the purpose of not only porting the game to an engine I understand, but to also make it easy to mod without fully decompiling the main Geometry Dash game. <br><br> DO NOT use this to pirate the game, it costs $5 on steam, just buy it. Plus, this doesn't use RobTops servers, so not fully pirating.

## Setup

1) Download Haxe: https://haxe.org/
2) Using Haxe, Get HaxeFlixel: https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/ <br> (I would suggest getting some knowledge on HaxeFlixel before, y'know, using it.)

If you are looking to build for Windows, download VS 2019 Community and click the C++ thing.

3) Build with `lime test html5`, or compile with other supported targets (with dependancies). <br> For example, Windows would be `lime test windows` <br> Debugging builds can be done by adding ` -debug` to the end of the lime command.

## Modifying

I tried my best to organize this code,
